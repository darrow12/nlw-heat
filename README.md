## About the project

On December 1st and 2nd, Rocketseat will hold one of its biggest events, DoWhile. It is a virtual event that brings together the entire programming ecosystem in search of the same purpose: building the future. With that in mind, they decided to hold the last Next Level Week of the year as a warm-up for the event.

The project consists of creating a badge for the event, containing your social networks, GitHub, name, and things that every badge has. To share the project, during the classes, a separate JavaScript file was created so that the person who is going to use the project can exchange their information very quickly.
